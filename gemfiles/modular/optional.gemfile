# Optional dependencies are not depended on directly, but may be used if present.
# git gem is not a direct dependency for two reasons:
# 1. it is incompatible with Truffleruby v23
# 2. it depends on activesupport, which is too heavy
gem "git", ">= 1.19.1"             # ruby >= 2.3

# URL parsing with Unicode support (falls back to URI if not available)
gem "addressable", ">= 2.8", "< 3" # ruby >= 2.2
