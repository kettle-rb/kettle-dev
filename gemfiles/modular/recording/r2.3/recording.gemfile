# HTTP recording for deterministic specs
# It seems that somehow just having a newer version of appraisal installed breaks
#   Ruby 2.3 and 2.4 even if their bundle specifies an older version,
#   and as a result it can only be a dependency in the appraisals.
#   Putting it here in recording.gemfile will satisfy the rubies that can load latest vcr.
