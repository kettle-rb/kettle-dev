## [Unreleased]
### Added
### Changed
### Deprecated
### Removed
### Fixed
### Security

## [1.0.8] - 2025-08-24
- TAG: [v1.0.8][1.0.8t]
- COVERAGE: 100.00% -- 130/130 lines in 7 files
- BRANCH COVERAGE:  96.00% -- 48/50 branches in 7 files
- 95.35% documented
### Fixed
- Can't add checksums to the gem package, because it changes the checksum (duh!)

## [1.0.7] - 2025-08-24
- TAG: [v1.0.7][1.0.7t]
- COVERAGE: 100.00% -- 130/130 lines in 7 files
- BRANCH COVERAGE:  96.00% -- 48/50 branches in 7 files
- 95.35% documented
### Fixed
- Reproducible builds, with consistent checksums, by *not* using SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH.
  - Since bundler v2.7.0 builds are reproducible by default.

## [1.0.6] - 2025-08-24
- TAG: [v1.0.6][1.0.6t]
- COVERAGE: 100.00% -- 130/130 lines in 7 files
- BRANCH COVERAGE:  96.00% -- 48/50 branches in 7 files
- 95.35% documented
### Fixed
- kettle-release: ensure SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH is applied within the same shell for both build and release by prefixing the commands with the env var (e.g., `SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH=$epoch bundle exec rake build` and `... rake release`); prevents losing the variable across shell boundaries and improves reproducible checksums.

## [1.0.5] - 2025-08-24
- TAG: [v1.0.5][1.0.5t]
- COVERAGE: 100.00% -- 130/130 lines in 7 files
- BRANCH COVERAGE:  96.00% -- 48/50 branches in 7 files
- 95.35% documented
### Fixed
- kettle-release: will run regardless of how it is invoked (i.e. works as binstub)

## [1.0.4] - 2025-08-24
- TAG: [v1.0.4][1.0.4t]
- COVERAGE: 100.00% -- 130/130 lines in 7 files
- BRANCH COVERAGE:  96.00% -- 48/50 branches in 7 files
- 95.35% documented
### Added
- kettle-release: checks all remotes for a GitHub remote and syncs origin/trunk with it; prompts to rebase or --no-ff merge when histories diverge; pushes to both origin and the GitHub remote on merge; uses the GitHub remote for GitHub Actions CI checks, and also checks GitLab CI when a GitLab remote and .gitlab-ci.yml are present.
- kettle-release: push logic improved â€” if a remote named `all` exists, push the current branch to it (assumed to cover multiple push URLs). Otherwise push the current branch to `origin` and to any GitHub, GitLab, and Codeberg remotes (whatever their names are).
### Fixed
- kettle-release now validates SHA256 checksums of the built gem against the recorded checksums and aborts on mismatch; helps ensure reproducible artifacts (honoring SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH).
- kettle-release now enforces CI checks and aborts if CI cannot be verified; supports GitHub Actions and GitLab pipelines, including releases from trunk/main.
- kettle-release no longer requires bundler/setup, preventing silent exits when invoked from a dependent project; adds robust output flushing.

## [1.0.3] - 2025-08-24
- TAG: [v1.0.3][1.0.3t]
- COVERAGE: 100.00% -- 98/98 lines in 7 files
- BRANCH COVERAGE: 100.00% -- 30/30 branches in 7 files
- 94.59% documented
### Added
- template task now copies .git-hooks files necessary for git hooks to work
### Fixed
- kettle-release now uses the host project's root, instead of this gem's installed root.
- Added .git-hooks files necessary for git hooks to work

## [1.0.2] - 2025-08-24
- TAG: [v1.0.2][1.0.2t]
- COVERAGE: 100.00% -- 98/98 lines in 7 files
- BRANCH COVERAGE: 100.00% -- 30/30 branches in 7 files
- 94.59% documented
### Fixed
- Added files necessary for kettle:dev:template task to work
- .github/workflows/opencollective.yml working!

## [1.0.1] - 2025-08-24
- TAG: [v1.0.1][1.0.1t]
- COVERAGE: 100.00% -- 98/98 lines in 7 files
- BRANCH COVERAGE: 100.00% -- 30/30 branches in 7 files
- 94.59% documented
### Added
- These were documented but not yet released:
  - `kettle-release` ruby script for safely, securely, releasing a gem.
      - This may move to its own gem in the future.
  - `kettle-readme-backers` ruby script for integrating Open Source Collective backers into a README.md file.
      - This may move to its own gem in the future.

## [1.0.0] - 2025-08-24
- TAG: [v1.0.0][1.0.0t]
- COVERAGE: 100.00% -- 98/98 lines in 7 files
- BRANCH COVERAGE: 100.00% -- 30/30 branches in 7 files
- 94.59% documented
### Added
- initial release, with auto-config support for:
  - bundler-audit
  - rake
  - require_bench
  - appraisal2
  - gitmoji-regex (& git-hooks to enforce gitmoji commit-style)
  - via kettle-test
    - Note: rake tasks for kettle-test are added in *this gem* (kettle-dev) because test rake tasks are a development concern
    - rspec
      - although rspec is the focus, most tools work with minitest as well
    - rspec-block_is_expected
    - rspec-stubbed_env
    - silent_stream
    - timecop-rspec
- `kettle:dev:install` rake task for installing githooks, and various instructions for optimal configuration
- `kettle:dev:template` rake task for copying most of this gem's files (excepting bin/, docs/, exe/, sig/, lib/, specs/) to another gem, as a template.
- `ci:act` rake task CLI menu / scoreboard for a project's GHA workflows
  - Selecting will run the selected workflow via `act`
  - This may move to its own gem in the future.
