- 50.41% documented

### Fixed

- kettle-jem-template-20260802-001 - Devcontainer JSON files now merge as JSONC,

## [2.5.16] - 2026-08-01

- TAG: [v2.5.16][2.5.16t]
- COVERAGE: 91.43% -- 5291/5787 lines in 46 files

- 50.41% documented

### Changed

- kettle-jem-template-20260801-001 - Generated README gem dashboard links now
  use ClickGems instead of BestGems.

### Fixed

- Pre-release image validation now permits a current-repository workflow badge when its workflow exists locally and awaits the release push.

- Release changelog coverage runs now enforce the checked-in coverage workflow line and branch thresholds before pushing.

- kettle-jem-template-20260801-002 - Generated RSpec helpers now normalize
  managed configuration block bindings structurally, preventing mixed block
  parameter names from producing invalid configuration after a merge.
- kettle-jem-template-20260801-003 - Generated project metadata and
  documentation now normalize configured underscore hostnames to valid
  hyphenated hostnames.
- kettle-jem-template-20260801-004 - Generated organization README logos now
  use GitHub's stable organization avatar endpoint instead of assuming a
  matching Galtzo-hosted asset exists.

- Mark modern changelog coverage-threshold tooling specs pending on legacy Ruby Appraisals.

## [2.5.15] - 2026-08-01

- TAG: [v2.5.15][2.5.15t]
- COVERAGE: 91.55% -- 5266/5752 lines in 46 files
- BRANCH COVERAGE: 75.74% -- 1986/2622 branches in 46 files
- 50.41% documented

### Added

- Add a changelog reformat mode for historical release metadata repair.

- Add historical changelog reformat and GitHub release reconciliation checks.

- Add an explicit historical release-section backfill mode for tagged releases.

- Add kettle-gh-release update mode for existing GitHub Release notes.

- Honor K_CHANGELOG_PATH when adding an Unreleased changelog entry.

- Canonicalize legacy release headings and remove redundant historical placeholders during reformat.

- Roll back unpublished prepared changelog sections when version.rb returns to the published version.

## [2.5.14] - 2026-07-31

- TAG: [v2.5.14][2.5.14t]
- COVERAGE: 91.94% -- 5146/5597 lines in 46 files
- BRANCH COVERAGE: 76.13% -- 1946/2556 branches in 46 files
- 50.41% documented

### Fixed

- `kettle-reset release-lockfiles` now requires SHA-256 checksums only for
  registry-sourced gems, allowing valid Git-sourced dependencies such as the
  `simplecov` fork to remain checksumless.

## [2.5.13] - 2026-07-31

- TAG: [v2.5.13][2.5.13t]
- COVERAGE: 91.81% -- 5137/5595 lines in 46 files
- BRANCH COVERAGE: 76.06% -- 1944/2556 branches in 46 files
- 50.41% documented

### Fixed

- `kettle-release` now treats `origin` as the default required parity remote
  while allowing optional mirror remotes to be skipped after fetch retries,
  so a transient Codeberg/GitLab mirror outage does not block publishing.

### Added

- `kettle-release --events` now emits `remote_parity` events for remote parity
  fetch attempts, skipped optional remotes, required failures, and parity
  completion.
- `kettle-release --events` now emits `ci_monitor` events around CI monitoring
  start, per-workflow GitHub Actions progress, GitLab pipeline outcomes,
  success, and failure.
- `kettle-release --events` now emits `pre_release` events around
  `kettle-pre-release` checks and selected check summaries.
- `kettle-changelog --events` now emits `changelog` events around release plan,
  coverage generation, and changelog update activity, and `kettle-release
  --events` forwards those child events.
- `kettle-release --events` now emits `release_lockfile` and `release_probe`
  events for release lockfile reset/validation and published-gem availability
  probes.
- `kettle-dev` now requires `kettle-ndjson` 0.1.9 or newer so release event
  streams resolve against the protocol that includes remote parity and CI
  monitor, pre-release, changelog, release lockfile, and release probe events.

- `kettle-release --events` now emits GitHub CI wait/start/tick monitor events
  while waiting for workflow runs to appear and complete.

### Changed

- `kettle-release --events` now emits clearer `command_step` names and compact
  per-command summaries for common release commands instead of shell-derived
  labels such as `env__u`.

## [2.5.12] - 2026-07-31

- TAG: [v2.5.12][2.5.12t]
- COVERAGE: 91.73% -- 4961/5408 lines in 46 files
- BRANCH COVERAGE: 75.98% -- 1850/2435 branches in 46 files
- 50.68% documented

### Added

- `kettle-release-secrets-doctor` can probe 1Password release secret
  authorization across same-process, child-process, and threaded shapes.

- `kettle-release-secrets-doctor` now probes additional 1Password
  authorization boundaries, including parent-child, Bundler child, and
  Bundler-env-reset child process shapes.

- `kettle-release --events` now emits `secret_provider` events around release
  secret keepalives and provider-backed prompt responses.

### Fixed

- `kettle-release` now keeps configured release secrets providers warm during
  CI waits and alerts before provider lookups, reducing missed 1Password
  authorization prompts during long release runs.

- `kettle-release` keepalive alerts now include the elapsed release time so
  delayed 1Password prompts are easier to correlate with the run.

- `kettle-dev` now requires `kettle-ndjson` 0.1.4 or newer so
  `kettle-release --events=secret_provider` cannot resolve against an older
  event protocol.
- `kettle-release` lockfile reset now preserves existing bundle platforms and
  adds the current host platform, preventing release-prep lockfiles from losing
  Linux support during full rebuilds.
- `kettle-pre-release` Markdown image URL normalization now keeps encoded query
  values stable, avoiding release-time churn in shields URLs with nested URL
  parameters.
- `kettle-release` now runs `bin/setup` with inherited Bundler bootstrap
  variables unset, so a release lockfile reset can install newly selected gems
  before later release tasks run.

## [2.5.11] - 2026-07-30

- TAG: [v2.5.11][2.5.11t]
- COVERAGE: 91.66% -- 4756/5189 lines in 44 files
- BRANCH COVERAGE: 76.03% -- 1802/2370 branches in 44 files
- 53.78% documented

### Fixed

- RubyGems version lookups now share the 30-day local version-response cache
  used by dependency floor checks, so release-state and changelog generation can
  survive transient RubyGems API failures for untouched gems while still
  refreshing recently released gems.
- RubyGems release-state cache-bust markers now stay fresh for 30 days after
  `kettle-release` publishes a gem, so downstream tooling can selectively
  refresh recently released gems without refreshing untouched gems.

## [2.5.10] - 2026-07-30

- TAG: [v2.5.10][2.5.10t]
- COVERAGE: 92.12% -- 4737/5142 lines in 44 files
- BRANCH COVERAGE: 76.41% -- 1785/2336 branches in 44 files
- 54.41% documented

### Fixed

- `kettle-changelog` coverage generation now clears inherited Bundler
  environment before running the coverage-root bundle, avoiding member bundle
  leakage in shared monorepo release changelogs.
- `kettle-changelog` coverage generation now carries `PATH` into its cleaned
  subprocess environment so the selected coverage-root bundle executable can be
  resolved without inheriting Bundler state.

## [2.5.9] - 2026-07-30

- TAG: [v2.5.9][2.5.9t]
- COVERAGE: 91.91% -- 4726/5142 lines in 44 files
- BRANCH COVERAGE: 76.37% -- 1784/2336 branches in 44 files
- 54.41% documented

### Fixed

- `kettle-changelog` coverage generation now pins `BUNDLE_GEMFILE` to
  `K_CHANGELOG_COVERAGE_ROOT/Gemfile`, so shared monorepo release changelogs
  collect aggregate family coverage instead of reusing the member bundle.

## [2.5.8] - 2026-07-30

- TAG: [v2.5.8][2.5.8t]
- COVERAGE: 92.10% -- 4733/5139 lines in 44 files
- BRANCH COVERAGE: 76.48% -- 1785/2334 branches in 44 files
- 54.41% documented

### Changed

- `kettle-changelog` now accepts `K_CHANGELOG_COVERAGE_ROOT` so monorepo release
  flows can collect aggregate coverage from a family bundle without running the
  changelog command from the family root.

## [2.5.7] - 2026-07-30

- TAG: [v2.5.7][2.5.7t]
- COVERAGE: 91.74% -- 4710/5134 lines in 44 files
- BRANCH COVERAGE: 76.37% -- 1781/2332 branches in 44 files
- 54.41% documented

### Added

### Changed

- Raised the runtime dependency floors for `kettle-ndjson` to `0.1.3` and
  `kettle-rb` to `0.1.7`.
- `kettle-changelog` now accepts `K_CHANGELOG_PATH` so monorepo release flows
  can run inside a gem while updating a shared root changelog.

### Fixed

- kettle-jem-template-20260728-004 - Generated dep-heads workflows now use the
  setup-ruby Bundler install path for direct appraisal Gemfiles, avoiding rv
  lockfile parser failures on Git and path dependencies.
- kettle-jem-template-20260728-005 - VersionGem bootstrap now creates the
  missing canonical version spec when a project only has shim namespace version
  specs.
- kettle-jem-template-20260729-001 - Generated JRuby 9.4 workflows now use the
  legacy manual bundle install path, avoiding setup-time Bundler full-index
  failures against `gem.coop`.
- kettle-jem-template-20260729-002 - VersionGem bootstrap now preserves
  and templates dedicated `version_gem.rb` entrypoints even when the gemspec
  dependency is intentionally omitted, and generated anonymous-loader specs
  cover both `version.rb` and `version_gem.rb`.
- kettle-jem-template-20260730-001 - Gemspec package file enumeration now runs
  relative to the gemspec directory, so packaged template assets are included
  even when the gemspec is loaded from another working directory.

## [2.5.6] - 2026-07-28

- TAG: [v2.5.6][2.5.6t]
- COVERAGE: 91.93% -- 4716/5130 lines in 44 files
- BRANCH COVERAGE: 76.39% -- 1780/2330 branches in 44 files
- 54.41% documented

### Fixed

- Unexpected Bundler environment warnings emitted by unbundled release/reset
  subprocess setup are now de-duplicated per process.

## [2.5.5] - 2026-07-28

- TAG: [v2.5.5][2.5.5t]
- COVERAGE: 91.66% -- 4694/5121 lines in 44 files
- BRANCH COVERAGE: 76.18% -- 1772/2326 branches in 44 files
- 54.44% documented

### Fixed

- `kettle-release` and `kettle-reset release-lockfiles` now validate local
  workspace gem versions with an isolated Bundler inline probe against the
  configured gem source instead of RubyGems.org version APIs, and release task
  lockfile resets retry transient source propagation failures.

- kettle-jem-template-20260728-002 - Generated RuboCop configs now ignore the
  same `gemfiles/vendor/bundle` tree as `.gitignore`, so vendored dependency
  installs are not reported as project lint debt.
- kettle-jem-template-20260728-003 - Generated dep-heads workflows now run
  TruffleRuby jobs with current RubyGems and Bundler, avoiding setup failures
  before the test suite starts.

- `kettle-release` and `kettle-reset` now warn when unexpected `BUNDLE_*` or
  `BUNDLER_*` environment variables are present while preparing unbundled
  subprocesses.

## [2.5.4] - 2026-07-28

- TAG: [v2.5.4][2.5.4t]
- COVERAGE: 91.68% -- 4618/5037 lines in 42 files
- BRANCH COVERAGE: 76.54% -- 1768/2310 branches in 42 files
- 56.04% documented

### Changed

- Raised the runtime dependency floor for `kettle-gha-pins` to `0.3.3`.

## [2.5.3] - 2026-07-27

- TAG: [v2.5.3][2.5.3t]
- COVERAGE: 91.86% -- 4627/5037 lines in 42 files
- BRANCH COVERAGE: 76.58% -- 1769/2310 branches in 42 files
- 56.04% documented

### Fixed

- `kettle-release` now resets release lockfiles before release task bundle
  installs, preventing stale `Appraisal.root.gemfile.lock` entries for
  unreleased sibling gems from aborting appraisal generation.

## [2.5.2] - 2026-07-27

- TAG: [v2.5.2][2.5.2t]
- COVERAGE: 91.92% -- 4619/5025 lines in 42 files
- BRANCH COVERAGE: 76.50% -- 1761/2302 branches in 42 files
- 56.04% documented

### Fixed

- `kettle-reset release-lockfiles` now detects local workspace gem versions
  that Bundler locked as registry gems even when checksum entries are present,
  so unreleased sibling versions are not committed into release lockfiles.

- `kettle-reset` now scans workspace sibling directories with Ruby 2.4
  compatible APIs, fixing Ruby 2.4 CI failures in lockfile reset specs.

### Changed

- kettle-jem-template-20260728-001 - Generated Ruby workflows now use clearer
  setup-ruby-flash planning and can prepare appraisal-only jobs without
  installing the main Gemfile bundle.

## [2.5.1] - 2026-07-27

- TAG: [v2.5.1][2.5.1t]
- COVERAGE: 91.69% -- 4590/5006 lines in 42 files
- BRANCH COVERAGE: 76.20% -- 1748/2294 branches in 42 files
- 56.21% documented

### Fixed

- `kettle-release --secrets-provider 1password` now supports
  `KETTLE_RELEASE_1PASSWORD_CLI` for systems where the `op` executable is not
  available on PATH.

## [2.5.0] - 2026-07-26

- TAG: [v2.5.0][2.5.0t]
- COVERAGE: 91.71% -- 4589/5004 lines in 42 files
- BRANCH COVERAGE: 75.98% -- 1743/2294 branches in 42 files
- 56.21% documented

### Added

- `kettle-release` can now use `--secrets-provider 1password` to load the gem
  signing passphrase and RubyGems MFA OTP from the local 1Password CLI during
  direct release runs.
- `kettle-release` and `kettle-changelog` now accept `--yes` to approve their
  release confirmation prompts without interactive input.

- `kettle-reset Gemfile.lock` now resets CI-facing lockfiles by disabling local
  sibling path environments and updating path-sourced or checksum-gap gems back
  to released registry versions with checksums.
- `kettle-reset Appraisal.root.gemfile.lock` and
  `kettle-reset release-lockfiles` now cover the appraisal root lockfile used by
  release and appraisal generation.

- kettle-jem-template-20260727-001 - Spec harness documentation now lists the
  RSpec helpers provided by `kettle-test`.

### Changed

- Documented family release credential automation with 1Password and the
  unreleased-family-gem cleanup workflow.
- Shared release secret provider code now lives in `kettle-dev`, allowing
  `kettle-family` to cache the signing passphrase once while child
  `kettle-release` processes fetch RubyGems OTP values at prompt time.

- `kettle-release` now skips the default task's duplicate test and coverage run
  when `kettle-changelog` already generated strict coverage in the same release.
- `kettle-changelog` now requests JSON-only coverage output for release metadata
  generation, reducing formatter noise during release preparation.

### Fixed

- `kettle-release --secrets-provider 1password` now validates the gem signing
  passphrase before build/release and aborts instead of prompting if configured
  secrets are unavailable.

- Direct `kettle-release --secrets-provider 1password` runs now use the same
  PTY-backed prompt bridge as family releases, so PEM passphrase prompts receive
  the configured provider value instead of leaking through interactively.

- `kettle-release --secrets-provider 1password` now recognizes the real
  1Password provider as configured instead of misclassifying it as the
  interactive fallback provider.

- Release secrets provider lookup now honors `provider` from explicit config,
  and direct provider lookup failures raise `Kettle::Dev::Error`.

- kettle-jem-template-20260726-003 - Coverage upload steps now treat Coveralls,
  QLTY, and Codecov as optional, so provider outages do not fail CI when local
  coverage thresholds still pass.

- `kettle-release` now uses the same lockfile reset logic before release prep
  commits, and can reset and amend release lockfiles before the first push if
  local paths reappear mid-release.
- Release lockfile validation now allows the current gem's own `gemspec` path
  source while still rejecting local sibling path sources.
- Release version checks now use RubyGems.org directly, while post-publish
  availability probes continue to verify the gem.coop Bundler source.
- Release lockfile reset now uninstalls unreleased locally installed workspace
  gem versions before regenerating `Gemfile.lock` and
  `Appraisal.root.gemfile.lock`, preventing local-only versions from being
  written as registry gems with checksums.

- Release and changelog specs now route git commit, amend, tag, reset, and
  release-state queries through `GitAdapter`, so test runs do not invoke the
  caller's real git signing configuration.

- `kettle-release` no longer loads the extracted `cgi` gem while booting, so
  Ruby 2.4 appraisals can run release executable smoke tests without hitting
  newer `cgi` code that requires `String#delete_prefix`.
- `kettle-release` now reports the exact lockfile diagnostics that trigger its
  pre-push reset attempt, amends the release prep commit only when tracked
  lockfiles changed, and reports unrepaired diagnostics before aborting.
- Release lockfile validation no longer treats the current gem's own
  `remote: .` lockfile source as a local sibling path when line endings or
  whitespace differ.

- Release lockfile validation now uses `Bundler::LockfileParser` for source
  classification, so registry remotes such as `https://gem.coop/` are not
  mistaken for local path sources.

- Release lockfile fallback output now distinguishes between amending the release
  prep commit and restoring uncommitted lockfile drift back to that commit.

## [2.4.6] - 2026-07-26

- TAG: [v2.4.6][2.4.6t]
- COVERAGE: 92.57% -- 4135/4467 lines in 38 files
- BRANCH COVERAGE: 76.58% -- 1612/2105 branches in 38 files
- 59.47% documented

### Added

- kettle-jem-template-20260726-001 - Projects now include YARD lint
  configuration and documentation dependencies so documentation issues fail
  before generated docs are refreshed.

### Changed

- Executable startup headers are now shown only when `--verbose` is passed;
  `-v` and `--version` still print just the executable version and exit.
- `yard:lint` now runs `yard-lint --quiet` first and only reruns with full
  output when lint fails, keeping warning-only default and release output
  compact while preserving failure diagnostics.
- `yard:lint` now runs before `yard` and before the default task reaches YARD
  documentation generation, so documentation lint failures fail earlier in CI.

- kettle-jem-template-20260725-002 - Version specs now use `anonymous_loader` to
  cover `version.rb` without redefining constants, or are removed when version
  specs are not managed for the project.

### Fixed

- `yard.rake` specs now account for appraisal bundles without documentation
  dependencies, so current-appraisal CI does not expect `yard:lint` when YARD
  is unavailable.
- Executable version specs now ignore RubyGems platform redefinition warnings
  from appraisal bundles while still failing on real executable stderr.
- `kettle-release` lockfile normalization now passes `--add-checksums` when it
  repairs release lockfiles, so empty CHECKSUMS entries are not left behind for
  the pre-commit validation pass.
- `kettle-release` lockfile normalization now passes `BUNDLE_LOCKFILE`, so
  appraisal root lockfiles are repaired in place instead of accidentally
  rewriting `Gemfile.lock`.
- `kettle-dvcs` documentation examples no longer use Ruby-only YARD example
  tags for shell commands, so `yard:lint` can pass before docs are regenerated.
- `kettle-changelog` now reports `bin/rake yard` failures directly, including
  `yard:lint` output, instead of misreporting them as missing documentation
  percentages.

- kettle-jem-template-20260726-002 - Generated version files now document their
  version namespace and constants, reducing warning-only YARD lint output.

## [2.4.5] - 2026-07-25

- TAG: [v2.4.5][2.4.5t]
- COVERAGE: 92.40% -- 4096/4433 lines in 38 files
- BRANCH COVERAGE: 76.57% -- 1598/2087 branches in 38 files
- 59.16% documented

### Fixed

- `kettle-release` availability validation now uses Bundler's resolver and
  installer without activating the just-published gem or re-entering the
  caller's repository bundle.

## [2.4.4] - 2026-07-25

- TAG: [v2.4.4][2.4.4t]
- COVERAGE: 92.01% -- 4079/4433 lines in 38 files
- BRANCH COVERAGE: 76.04% -- 1587/2087 branches in 38 files
- 59.16% documented

### Fixed

- `kettle-release` availability validation now resolves the exact published gem
  from gem.coop without requiring it, so framework-dependent gems are not
  mistaken for unavailable releases after RubyGems accepts the push.
- `kettle-release` now records a candidate as published immediately after the
  push command succeeds, preventing post-publish validation failures from
  triggering unpublished-gem local cleanup.

- Legacy-engine GitHub Actions workflows now configure Bundler to mirror
  gem.coop to RubyGems.org during explicit CI installs, avoiding unsupported
  gem.coop full-index requests from old Bundler/RubyGems combinations.

## [2.4.3] - 2026-07-25

- TAG: [v2.4.3][2.4.3t]
- COVERAGE: 92.17% -- 4082/4429 lines in 38 files
- BRANCH COVERAGE: 76.38% -- 1594/2087 branches in 38 files
- 59.16% documented

### Added

- `kettle-release` now supports `--events[=TYPES]`, `--json`, and
  `--report PATH` machine-readable release reporting backed by the shared
  `kettle-ndjson` event toolkit.

### Changed

- kettle-jem-template-20260725-001 - Generated JRuby and TruffleRuby workflow
  files now run when pull request head branches start with `feature/release`,
  so release CI monitoring does not report intentionally skipped engine
  workflows as failures.

### Fixed

- `kettle-release` now retries transient git remote fetch failures during
  strict pre-push trunk parity checks, and failures now include an explicit
  `--skip-remotes` recovery hint for intentionally unavailable remotes.
- `kettle-release` now waits briefly and retries post-publish gem.coop
  availability validation before failing, so normal registry mirror lag does
  not abort immediately after a successful RubyGems push.

- Raised the `kettle-ndjson` runtime dependency floor to v0.1.1 so the
  dependency remains installable on kettle-dev's Ruby 2.4+ support floor.

## [2.4.2] - 2026-07-24

- TAG: [v2.4.2][2.4.2t]
- COVERAGE: 92.36% -- 3991/4321 lines in 38 files
- BRANCH COVERAGE: 76.06% -- 1563/2055 branches in 38 files
- 59.00% documented

### Fixed

- `kettle-release` now validates published gem availability with an isolated
  Bundler probe against gem.coop before continuing past the publish step, and
  uninstalls newly introduced local candidate gems when the release did not
  happen or cannot be validated.

## [2.4.1] - 2026-07-24

- TAG: [v2.4.1][2.4.1t]
- COVERAGE: 92.29% -- 3928/4256 lines in 38 files
- BRANCH COVERAGE: 76.09% -- 1550/2037 branches in 38 files
- 58.66% documented

### Fixed

- `kettle-release` now normalizes and revalidates release lockfiles after
  mutating setup/appraisal/doc steps, before committing or pushing, so local
  path remotes and locally installed registry gems with empty lockfile
  checksums cannot leak into CI.

## [2.4.0] - 2026-07-23

- TAG: [v2.4.0][2.4.0t]
- COVERAGE: 92.49% -- 3830/4141 lines in 38 files
- BRANCH COVERAGE: 76.22% -- 1516/1989 branches in 38 files
- 58.66% documented

### Added

- Packaged executables now answer `-v` and bare `--version` with the
  `kettle-dev` gem version they shipped with.

### Changed

- Raised the runtime dependency floor for `kettle-gha-pins` to `0.3.1`.
- Packaged executables now share a consistent startup header on normal
  execution paths.
- Markdown image URL cache/live/skipped progress now uses the same multi-line
  `tty-progressbar` output as GitHub Actions pin checks.

## [2.3.11] - 2026-07-23

- TAG: [v2.3.11][2.3.11t]
- COVERAGE: 92.17% -- 3791/4113 lines in 37 files
- BRANCH COVERAGE: 75.80% -- 1500/1979 branches in 37 files
- 59.51% documented

### Fixed

- GitHub Actions release monitoring now falls back to repository-level workflow
  runs when a per-workflow endpoint lags for the pushed HEAD, and waits up to
  five minutes by default for workflows to appear.

## [2.3.10] - 2026-07-23

- TAG: [v2.3.10][2.3.10t]
- COVERAGE: 92.35% -- 3790/4104 lines in 37 files
- BRANCH COVERAGE: 75.95% -- 1500/1975 branches in 37 files
- 60.00% documented

### Changed

- Local development tooling now uses `kettle-gha-pins` 0.2.0 or newer on
  Ruby 3.2+, while keeping older supported Ruby bundles solvable.
- `kettle-gha-sha-pins` now delegates GitHub Actions release-tag parsing,
  canonicalization, cache persistence, GitHub release/tag/commit resolution,
  and upgrade-target selection to the shared
  `kettle-gha-pins` gem.
- `kettle-gha-sha-pins` is now a compatibility wrapper around the
  `kettle-gha-pins` executable.

### Fixed

- Restored `kettle-gha-pins` as a normal runtime dependency now that 0.2.1
  supports the full `kettle-dev` Ruby floor.

- Appraisal rake task specs now rely on kettle-test's `silent_stream`
  integration instead of stubbing `Object#warn`, which is not supported under
  JRuby 9.4.

## [2.3.9] - 2026-07-21

- TAG: [v2.3.9][2.3.9t]
- COVERAGE: 92.06% -- 4443/4826 lines in 37 files
- BRANCH COVERAGE: 74.09% -- 1733/2339 branches in 37 files
- 54.64% documented

### Fixed

- `kettle-release` now records a short-lived gem.coop release-state cache-bust
  marker after publishing, and `kettle-changelog --release-state` uses it to
  refresh just-published gem version lookups.

- `dep-heads.yml` now runs each engine directly from
  `gemfiles/dep_heads.gemfile`, avoiding `Appraisal.root.gemfile` bootstrap
  failures with RubyGems/Bundler and gem.coop before the dep-heads appraisal is
  selected.

## [2.3.8] - 2026-07-21

- TAG: [v2.3.8][2.3.8t]
- COVERAGE: 91.98% -- 4379/4761 lines in 36 files
- BRANCH COVERAGE: 73.91% -- 1711/2315 branches in 36 files
- 56.04% documented

### Added

- `kettle-changelog --release-state` now reports an `ahead` value counting
  commits from the latest release tag to the local default branch when
  available.
- `kettle-release` now accepts `--skip-remotes` and
  `K_RELEASE_SKIP_REMOTES` to exclude temporarily unavailable git remotes from
  release fetch/push parity checks.
- `kettle-release` now creates or reuses an open GitHub pull request for
  non-trunk release branches before waiting for GitHub Actions, so
  pull-request-only workflows start after release branch pushes.

### Changed

- kettle-jem-template-20260720-002 - Generated development Gemfiles now use the
  released `tree_sitter_language_pack` gem 1.13.3 or newer by default.
- kettle-jem-template-20260720-003 - Generated StructuredMerge Git diff driver
  config now uses the installed `smorg-rb` Ruby driver name.
- kettle-jem-template-20260720-005 - Generated README Support & Community rows
  now include a RubyForum help badge.

## [2.3.7] - 2026-07-18

- BRANCH COVERAGE: 74.20% -- 1694/2283 branches in 36 files
- 56.25% documented

### Fixed

- `kettle-gha-sha-pins` now canonicalizes duplicate equivalent action tags,
  preferring explicit release tags such as `v7.0.0` over major-line aliases
  such as `v7`, so adjacent version comments do not flip between spellings.

## [2.3.6] - 2026-07-17

- TAG: [v2.3.6][2.3.6t]
- COVERAGE: 91.85% -- 4292/4673 lines in 36 files
- BRANCH COVERAGE: 73.94% -- 1685/2279 branches in 36 files
- 56.67% documented

### Added

- `kettle-release` now accepts `--ci-workflows` and
  `K_RELEASE_CI_WORKFLOWS` to monitor an explicit workflow subset at the CI
  wait step while retaining the default behavior of waiting for all applicable
  workflows.

### Changed

- kettle-jem-template-20260716-002 - Generated gemspec manifests now ship fewer
  repository-only files by default to reduce downstream distro packaging churn.

### Fixed

- `kettle-release --ci-workflows` now rejects a missing value when the next
  token is another flag, and the release CI workflow subset APIs now have
  matching RBS signatures.

## [2.3.5] - 2026-07-16

- TAG: [v2.3.5][2.3.5t]
- COVERAGE: 92.03% -- 4297/4669 lines in 36 files
- BRANCH COVERAGE: 74.02% -- 1684/2275 branches in 36 files
- 56.88% documented

### Changed

- Updated the `kettle-rb` runtime dependency floor to `>= 0.1.2`.

### Fixed

- `kettle-changelog` now honors `K_CHANGELOG_GEM_NAME` before root gemspec
  discovery, allowing root changelogs for gem families to query live release
  data without requiring a synthetic root gemspec.

## [2.3.4] - 2026-07-14

### Fixed

- GitHub Actions release monitoring now ignores `scorecard-analysis.yml` by
  default, matching other maintenance workflows that may not start on release
  commits.

## [2.3.3] - 2026-07-13

- TAG: [v2.3.3][2.3.3t]

- BRANCH COVERAGE: 72.80% -- 1678/2305 branches in 36 files

### Fixed

- AST-based version edits now apply Prism byte offsets as byte offsets, avoiding
  corrupted Ruby when non-ASCII content appears before the edited string.

## [2.3.2] - 2026-07-13

- TAG: [v2.3.2][2.3.2t]

- BRANCH COVERAGE: 73.15% -- 1686/2305 branches in 36 files
- 57.09% documented

### Fixed

- `kettle-bump patch` now finalizes prerelease versions to the matching full
  release instead of rejecting non-numeric prerelease segments.

## [2.3.1] - 2026-07-10

- TAG: [v2.3.1][2.3.1t]
- COVERAGE: 91.69% -- 4271/4658 lines in 36 files
- BRANCH COVERAGE: 73.08% -- 1683/2303 branches in 36 files
- 57.30% documented

### Added

- `kettle-pre-release` now skips volatile star-history image URLs by default
  during Markdown image validation, and accepts additional
  `.kettle-family.yml` or `KETTLE_FAMILY_CONFIG` patterns under
  `pre_release.image_url_skip_patterns`.

- `kettle-release --skip-bundle-audit` and `KETTLE_DEV_SKIP_BUNDLE_AUDIT=true`
  now disable the release-flow `bundle:audit` and `bundle:audit:update` rake
  defaults so a known advisory can be handled outside the automated release.

### Changed

- `require "kettle/dev"` no longer loads `version_gem` by default; require
  `kettle/dev/version_gem` for the optional `VersionGem::Basic` extension.

### Fixed

- Legacy-engine CI workflows now install Bundler gems under
  `${RUNNER_TEMP}/bundle` instead of `vendor/bundle`, and RuboCop now excludes
  nested `vendor/` trees such as `gemfiles/vendor`.

- `kettle-release --skip-bundle-audit` now also prefixes release `bin/rake`
  commands with `KETTLE_DEV_SKIP_BUNDLE_AUDIT=true`, ensuring the skip reaches
  the rake process during release checks.

## [2.3.0] - 2026-07-02

- 58.02% documented

### Added

- `Kettle::Dev::VersionBump` now exposes the reusable engine behind
  `kettle-bump`, so other tools can share version detection, target resolution,
  Prism edits, and write behavior without shelling out or duplicating logic.

## [2.2.25] - 2026-07-01

### Changed

- Updated the `kettle-rb` runtime dependency floor to 0.1.1.

### Fixed

- Package configured license files in gem release file lists.

- YAML config loading remains compatible with older Psych releases on legacy
  Rubies that do not provide `YAML.safe_load_file` or keyword options for
  `YAML.safe_load`.

- JRuby head CI now skips the release-flow specs that trigger repeated
  `jopenssl/load.rb` warning floods while the upstream JRuby/JOpenSSL recursion
  is investigated.

## [2.2.24] - 2026-06-29

- 59.83% documented

### Changed

- `Kettle::EmojiRegex::REGEX` now delegates to the `emoji_regex` runtime
  dependency instead of carrying a vendored regex snapshot.
- `kettle-pre-release` image URL validation and `kettle-gha-sha-pins` action
  resolution now report cached and live checks with progress bars instead of
  printing every checked URL or action reference.

## [2.2.23] - 2026-06-28

### Fixed

- `kettle-release` no longer tries to switch an active local/dev checkout when
  the release is running from that same branch-stack checkout.

## [2.2.22] - 2026-06-28

- TAG: [v2.2.22][2.2.22t]

- BRANCH COVERAGE: 73.08% -- 1653/2262 branches in 33 files
- 61.04% documented

### Fixed

- `kettle-release` now passes the exact built gem artifact to `bin/gem_checksums`
  so stale packages in `pkg/` cannot cause checksums for the wrong version.

## [2.2.21] - 2026-06-28

### Fixed

- `kettle-release` now detects local `.kettle-family.yml` branch-stack release
  targets and skips trunk sync, trunk merge, and trunk checkout for those release
  branches.

## [2.2.20] - 2026-06-27

- BRANCH COVERAGE: 72.73% -- 1632/2244 branches in 33 files
- 61.04% documented

### Added

- `kettle-release` now accepts `skip_steps=...` / `--skip-steps ...` to skip
  selected numbered release steps while running the rest of the release flow.

### Fixed

- `kettle-release` now suppresses inherited Bundler/debug verbosity when running
  release child commands and Appraisal bundle installs.

- `kettle-release` now switches a local `RUBOCOP_LTS_LOCAL` checkout to the
  branch matching the project's selected `rubocop-rubyN_N` style gem before
  running setup and default rake tasks.

- Restored Ruby 2.4 parser compatibility for recent release and CI helper code.

### Changed

- `kettle-release` now reads RuboCop LTS branch selection from
  `Kettle::Rb::CompatMatrix`.

- 61.84% documented

### Changed

- `kettle-release` now runs `bin/rake appraisal:generate` by default when
  `Appraisals` is present; use `--appraisal-update` or
  `KETTLE_RELEASE_APPRAISAL_TASK=appraisal:update` for the slower lock-resolving
  update path.

## [2.2.18] - 2026-06-24

- BRANCH COVERAGE: 73.19% -- 1616/2208 branches in 33 files
- 62.11% documented

### Fixed

- `kettle-changelog --release-state` now reports the latest released version
  for the current major line as `latest_released`, so branch-stacked gems such
  as `rubocop-lts` do not display the newest release from a different major
  branch in family release-state tables.

## [2.2.17] - 2026-06-24

### Changed

- `kettle-release` start step 0 now runs `kettle-changelog` after the
  `kettle-pre-release` gates so release prep generates the versioned changelog
  section before the numbered release steps.

### Fixed

- `kettle-release` now invokes `bundle exec kettle-changelog` as an interactive
  command, making the changelog plan banner and confirmation prompt visible
  during release prep.

## [2.2.15] - 2026-06-21

- BRANCH COVERAGE: 73.01% -- 1599/2190 branches in 33 files
- 62.11% documented

### Added

- `kettle-changelog --add-unreleased-entry` now adds one non-duplicate entry to
  an existing templated `## [Unreleased]` subsection using the Markly CRISPR
  Markdown adapter, failing closed when the expected section shape is absent.

- Added support for JRuby 10.1 and TruffleRuby 34.0.

### Changed

- Retemplated project metadata and CI/development automation with `kettle-jem` v7.0.0.

- Allow local coverage runs to opt into a vendored `simplecov` checkout through
  the existing nomono `VENDORED_GEMS` workflow.

### Fixed

- Corrected OpenCollective funding metadata to use the `kettle-dev` collective.
- `kettle-gha-sha-pins` now refreshes large action repositories without eagerly
  dereferencing irrelevant annotated tags, bounds GitHub API refreshes with
  explicit timeouts, and falls back to stale cache data only when refresh fails.

- Covered `kettle-changelog --add-unreleased-entry` insertion, duplicate, and
  fail-closed error behavior in the normal development bundle.

- `kettle-changelog` now treats prerelease sections such as `3.0.0.rc3` as
  release sections when detecting or updating the latest prepared release.
- Fixed seed-dependent coverage by starting SimpleCov before test support loads,
  covering `version.rb`, and making rake task specs cover their task wiring
  branches deterministically.

- BRANCH COVERAGE: 73.97% -- 1566/2117 branches in 28 files
- 63.76% documented

### Fixed

- `kettle-release` now treats `kettle-pre-release` as step 0, so any
  `start_step` greater than 0 skips pre-release gates and resumes directly at
  the requested numbered release step.

## [2.2.12] - 2026-06-18

### Added

- Added `--version VERSION` support to `kettle-changelog` and `kettle-release`
  for shim gems whose release version is intentionally sourced outside the local
  `lib/**/version.rb` file.

### Fixed

- Updated `kettle-changelog` and `kettle-pre-release` help text to match current
  coverage generation, documentation stats, and image URL cache behavior.

### Fixed

- `kettle-bump` now prefers the gemspec-declared version file before scanning
  `lib/**/version.rb`, so compatibility alias version files do not block version
  bumps.

- COVERAGE: 92.24% -- 3911/4240 lines in 28 files
- BRANCH COVERAGE: 73.87% -- 1552/2101 branches in 28 files
- 64.35% documented

### Changed

- `kettle-pre-release` now caches successful Markdown image URL validations in
  the global kettle-dev state cache for seven days to avoid repeated network
  HEAD requests during release readiness checks.

## [2.2.9] - 2026-06-14

- TAG: [v2.2.9][2.2.9t]
- COVERAGE: 92.57% -- 3863/4173 lines in 28 files
- BRANCH COVERAGE: 74.00% -- 1534/2073 branches in 28 files
- 65.38% documented

### Fixed

- `kettle-gha-sha-pins --check` no longer fails solely because releases outside
  the selected `--upgrade` policy exist, and `kettle-pre-release` now validates
  workflow pins with the inclusive `major` policy used for release readiness.

- `kettle-gha-sha-pins --write` now handles major-line adjacent version comments
  such as `# v7` idempotently instead of repeatedly planning the same
  `update_version_comment` change.

## [2.2.8] - 2026-06-13

- TAG: [v2.2.8][2.2.8t]
- COVERAGE: 92.40% -- 3854/4171 lines in 28 files
- BRANCH COVERAGE: 73.37% -- 1521/2073 branches in 28 files
- 66.02% documented

### Fixed

#### Changelog

- `kettle-changelog --release-state` now reports a clear family-root hint when
  run outside a single gem instead of raising a missing `CHANGELOG.md` stack
  trace.
- `kettle-changelog --release-state` now reports a successful no-changelog state
  for individual gems that do not have a `CHANGELOG.md`.

## [2.2.7] - 2026-06-13

- TAG: [v2.2.7][2.2.7t]
- COVERAGE: 92.36% -- 3843/4161 lines in 28 files

- 66.02% documented

### Added

#### Changelog

- Added `kettle-changelog --release-state` / `--release-status` with optional
  `--json` output for single-gem changelog release state reporting.
- Added a richer `Kettle::Dev::ChangelogCLI#release_state` API that reports the
  latest released version, latest changelog release section, and pending
  changelog sources.

## [2.2.6] - 2026-06-13

- TAG: [v2.2.6][2.2.6t]
- COVERAGE: 92.27% -- 3833/4154 lines in 28 files
- BRANCH COVERAGE: 73.51% -- 1518/2065 branches in 28 files
- 66.67% documented

### Added

#### Changelog

- Added `kettle-changelog --pending-release`, a non-mutating query that exits
  successfully when `CHANGELOG.md` has unreleased entries or its most recent
  release section has not been published yet.

## [2.2.5] - 2026-06-13

- TAG: [v2.2.5][2.2.5t]
- COVERAGE: 92.29% -- 3818/4137 lines in 28 files
- BRANCH COVERAGE: 73.49% -- 1516/2063 branches in 28 files
- 67.00% documented

### Changed

- `kettle-gha-sha-pins --upgrade major` now supports major-line action tags
  such as `v2`, while patch and minor upgrade targeting remain limited to full
  `x.y.z` SemVer tags.

### Fixed

- `kettle-gha-sha-pins` persistent cache writes no longer crash for actions
  whose releases and tags only include major-line versions such as `v2`.

## [2.2.4] - 2026-06-12

- TAG: [v2.2.4][2.2.4t]
- COVERAGE: 92.18% -- 3806/4129 lines in 28 files
- BRANCH COVERAGE: 73.26% -- 1507/2057 branches in 28 files
- 67.00% documented

### Changed

- Retemplated generated project files with the current `kettle-jem` template,
  refreshing development dependency floors, binstubs, README metadata, and RBS
  validation workflow output.

### Fixed

- `kettle-gha-sha-pins --upgrade` no longer downgrades action pins when the
  current SHA matches a newer version-like tag that is a prerelease or lacks a
  GitHub Release, including transferred action repositories that require GitHub
  API redirects.

## [2.2.3] - 2026-06-09

- TAG: [v2.2.3][2.2.3t]
- COVERAGE: 91.76% -- 3762/4100 lines in 28 files
- BRANCH COVERAGE: 72.91% -- 1483/2034 branches in 28 files
- 67.00% documented

### Fixed

- `kettle-pre-release` Markdown image checks now inspect project Markdown files
  instead of recursive scratch output such as `tmp/template_test`.

## [2.2.2] - 2026-06-09

- TAG: [v2.2.2][2.2.2t]
- COVERAGE: 92.04% -- 3758/4083 lines in 28 files
- BRANCH COVERAGE: 72.95% -- 1478/2026 branches in 28 files
- 66.83% documented

### Changed

- `kettle-gha-sha-pins` now scans only the selected workflow directory,
  defaulting to `.github/workflows`, instead of recursively searching every
  nested `.github/workflows` directory under the project root.

### Fixed

- Updated generated project metadata links to use the migrated `kettle-dev`
  GitHub organization, including README QLTY badge URLs.

## [2.2.1] - 2026-06-09

- TAG: [v2.2.1][2.2.1t]
- COVERAGE: 91.61% -- 3736/4078 lines in 28 files
- BRANCH COVERAGE: 72.78% -- 1473/2024 branches in 28 files
- 66.83% documented

### Fixed

- `Kettle::Dev::GemSpecReader` now falls back to the migrated `kettle-dev`
  GitHub organization when no forge org can be derived.
- `kettle-gha-sha-pins` now persists live ref-to-SHA lookup results in its action
  cache so a dry run followed by `--write` does not repeat the same API calls.
- Restored `docs/CNAME` so the generated documentation site keeps its custom domain.

## [2.2.0] - 2026-06-08

- TAG: [v2.2.0][2.2.0t]
- COVERAGE: 91.51% -- 3710/4054 lines in 28 files
- BRANCH COVERAGE: 72.90% -- 1458/2000 branches in 28 files
- 67.51% documented

### Added

- `kettle-pre-release` now runs `kettle-gha-sha-pins --check` before release
  checks, failing with an outdated-actions summary and recommended
  `kettle-gha-sha-pins --write --upgrade patch` command when workflow actions
  need updated SHA pins.
- `kettle-release` now runs `kettle-pre-release` as a full-release gate before
  release setup starts.
- `kettle-bump` now bumps a single gem's version file before `kettle-changelog`
  release prep.
- `kettle-gha-sha-pins` now shows discovery, workflow scan, and action-resolution
  progress on STDERR for human runs while keeping JSON output quiet by default.
- `kettle-gha-sha-pins` now times action resolution, caches one resolution plan
  per action repository, and uses GitHub REST tag-ref lookups to avoid resolving
  every release tag through individual commit requests.

- `kettle-gha-sha-pins` now keeps a 24-hour persistent action release cache at
  the XDG state location and supports `--refresh-cache` to bypass stale entries
  while preserving cached discoveries for other projects and actions.

### Fixed

- Minitest-only projects now keep `rake test` on the generated
  `Rake::TestTask` path instead of synthesizing a `kettle-test` RSpec task when
  tests live directly under `test/`.

- `kettle-release start_step=10` now waits for GitHub Actions runs for the
  local HEAD SHA to appear before evaluating results, avoiding stale failures
  from the previous branch run.
- Removed the duplicate `cgi` declaration from the `head` appraisal so
  `kettle-release` can regenerate Appraisal gemfiles on Ruby 4.

- `kettle-gha-sha-pins` now treats version-equivalent but unresolved action
  refs as invalid and converts them to release SHAs instead of accepting
  stripped tag names such as `6.0.2` when only `v6.0.2` exists.
- `kettle-gha-sha-pins --write` now refreshes adjacent release-version comments
  when the pinned SHA is current but the comment is stale.
- `kettle-gha-sha-pins` now uses `GH_TOKEN` or `gh auth token` as a fallback
  when `GITHUB_TOKEN` is not set, avoiding false clean reports after
  unauthenticated GitHub API rate limits are exhausted.
- Coverage workflow uploads now pin `codecov/codecov-action` and
  `coverallsapp/github-action` to resolvable release SHAs.

- Ruby 2.4-2.6 CI appraisals now include `backports`, and Ruby 3.0-3.1
  appraisals include `prism`, so `kettle-bump` and GitHub Action SHA pin specs
  run on the supported legacy matrix.

- Legacy CI appraisals now skip `kettle-bump` specs when Prism is unavailable,
  and the Ruby 3.2 appraisal includes `prism` so the specs run where supported.

### Changed

- Retemplated project metadata with the latest `kettle-jem` stack, refreshing
  README and security-policy generated details for the current release line.

- Runtime dependency `kettle-test` now requires 2.0.4 or newer.

## [2.1.1] - 2026-06-06

- TAG: [v2.1.1][2.1.1t]
- COVERAGE: 93.11% -- 2988/3209 lines in 25 files
- BRANCH COVERAGE: 77.58% -- 1218/1570 branches in 25 files
- 75.93% documented

### Added

- `kettle-release --local-ci` for sensitive releases that run `act` locally,
  publish the gem before any git push, create the release tag locally, and push
  commits and tags only after publishing succeeds.

### Changed

- Refreshed kettle-jem template output, including Appraisal2 plugin wiring and
  current dependency floors for `appraisal2`, `appraisal2-rubocop`, and
  `version_gem`.

## [2.1.0] - 2026-06-06

- TAG: [v2.1.0][2.1.0t]
- COVERAGE: 93.52% -- 2973/3179 lines in 25 files
- BRANCH COVERAGE: 77.58% -- 1204/1552 branches in 25 files
- 75.93% documented

### Changed

- `appraisal:install` now uses `appraisal generate-install`, and
  `appraisal:update` now uses `appraisal generate-update`, preserving
  generation-before-resolution behavior after Appraisal2 split pure install and
  update commands from generation.
- Appraisal gemfile cleanup is no longer run directly by kettle-dev appraisal
  tasks; projects that need generated gemfile normalization should load an
  Appraisal2 plugin hook such as `appraisal2-rubocop`.

## [2.0.8] - 2026-06-02

- TAG: [v2.0.8][2.0.8t]
- COVERAGE: 92.83% -- 2953/3181 lines in 25 files
- BRANCH COVERAGE: 76.59% -- 1201/1568 branches in 25 files
- 75.93% documented

### Fixed

- `appraisal:update` now installs the `Appraisal.root.gemfile` bundle before
  running `bundle update --bundler`, fixing first-run release failures when the
  Appraisal root lockfile does not exist yet.

## [2.0.7] - 2026-06-01

- TAG: [v2.0.7][2.0.7t]
- COVERAGE: 93.14% -- 2961/3179 lines in 25 files
- BRANCH COVERAGE: 76.88% -- 1204/1566 branches in 25 files
- 75.93% documented

### Changed

- Runtime dependency `kettle-test` now requires 2.0.2 or newer.
- Generated style Gemfiles now use the current RuboCop-LTS Ruby 2.4 floor.
- Lint / style updates

### Fixed

- Avoided moving mocked CI task input reads into a background thread for
  non-interactive runs, fixing TruffleRuby v23.0-v23.1 CI stability.

## [2.0.6] - 2026-05-31

- TAG: [v2.0.6][2.0.6t]
- COVERAGE: 93.14% -- 2961/3179 lines in 25 files
- BRANCH COVERAGE: 76.95% -- 1205/1566 branches in 25 files
- 75.93% documented

### Added

- `kettle-changelog` now supports monorepo version files, allowing release
  preparation for gems whose version constants live below subproject roots.

### Changed

- Refreshed generated `kettle-jem` template output, including
  `.structuredmerge` configuration, Git diff driver setup, RuboCop-LTS RSpec
  style dependencies, and release task wiring.

- Updated the user-maintained README usage sections to describe the current
  kettle-dev task, changelog, release, and kettle-jem setup boundaries.
- Corrected the deprecated `kettle-dev-setup` documentation and shim output to
  point at the real `kettle-jem setup` command.
- Refreshed the README with current kettle-jem logo templating, including
  128px HTML logo output and the Ruby Toolbox language-logo link.
- Moved the generated related-org and Ruby README logos from the H1 to the
  Synopsis heading with the current kettle-jem width defaults.
- Added the generated README note that identifies kettle-jem and
  StructuredMerge as the templating and merge-contract tooling.

### Fixed

- Regenerated the spec helper so `kettle-dev` is required only after coverage
  bootstrap setup.

## [2.0.5] - 2026-05-28

- TAG: [v2.0.5][2.0.5t]
- COVERAGE: 93.46% -- 2972/3180 lines in 25 files
- BRANCH COVERAGE: 76.94% -- 1208/1570 branches in 25 files
- 76.40% documented

### Added

- Added `appraisal:generate`, which regenerates Appraisal gemfiles inside the
  `Appraisal.root.gemfile` bundle context without resolving appraisal locks.

## [2.0.4] - 2026-05-27

- TAG: [v2.0.4][2.0.4t]
- COVERAGE: 94.42% -- 2944/3118 lines in 24 files
- BRANCH COVERAGE: 78.22% -- 1203/1538 branches in 24 files
- 76.40% documented

### Fixed

- `kettle-changelog` now refuses to merge Unreleased entries or generated
  metadata into a release section when `version.rb` already matches the latest
  published version for that release line; bump the version before preparing a
  new changelog release.
- The `yard` rake spec now reloads the task file directly and uses Ruby
  2.4-compatible cleanup syntax, fixing order-dependent CI failures across the
  appraisal matrix.
- The `yard` rake fallback task now remains registered with kettle-dev defaults
  when the optional `yard` gem is unavailable in an appraisal environment.
- The Rakefile now falls back to a stub `kettle:jem:selftest` task when the
  installed `kettle-jem` package does not expose rake task installation.

## [2.0.3] - 2026-05-27

- TAG: [v2.0.3][2.0.3t]
- COVERAGE: 94.62% -- 2956/3124 lines in 24 files
- BRANCH COVERAGE: 78.21% -- 1206/1542 branches in 24 files
- 76.40% documented

### Fixed

- The default rake task now includes documentation generation via `yard`, so
  documentation plugin post-processing runs during `bin/rake`.
- `kettle-changelog` now updates the current changelog release in place when
  Unreleased has pending entries or the release section is missing generated
  coverage/documentation metadata, even if the version is already the latest
  known release.

## [2.0.2] - 2026-05-27

- TAG: [v2.0.2][2.0.2t]
- COVERAGE: 94.71% -- 2937/3101 lines in 23 files
- BRANCH COVERAGE: 78.23% -- 1200/1534 branches in 23 files
- 76.40% documented

### Changed

- **BREAKING**: Raised the minimum Ruby version to 2.4.0, matching
  `kettle-test` 2.x and its runtime `turbo_tests2` dependency.
- `kettle-test` is now declared as a runtime dependency because the shipped rake
  and changelog tasks invoke `bundle exec kettle-test`.
- Refreshed generated template output for README badge formatting and
  Ruby 2.4-targeted RuboCop LTS style dependencies.

### Removed

- Removed Ruby 2.3 and JRuby 9.1 CI workflows and appraisal gemfiles.

### Fixed

- `ci:act` and release CI monitoring now detect GitHub and GitLab repositories
  when remotes use `git+ssh://` or `ssh://` URLs.
- Appraisal-based CI gemfiles now load the version-appropriate VCR/WebMock
  recording dependencies required by the spec helper without falling back to the
  root Gemfile.
- Reek, RuboCop-LTS, and coverage task specs now run in coverage CI without
  requiring style-only dependencies.
- Reek rake task specs no longer change the process working directory, avoiding
  cross-spec project root leakage under turbo workers.
- `rake reek:update` now raises a normal task error on unexpected reek exits
  instead of calling `Kernel.abort`, so specs can assert the failure path without
  poisoning the process exit status.
- Coverage CI thresholds now match the repository `mise.toml` thresholds instead
  of requiring unreachable 100% line and branch coverage.
- `kettle-changelog` now fails closed when `kettle-test` does not produce the
  expected collated `coverage/coverage.json`, instead of merging worker coverage
  files itself and hiding a coverage integration failure.
- Regenerated templating now keeps `kettle-test` as a runtime dependency only
  instead of duplicating it as both runtime and development dependency.
- Replaced non-capturing `=~` checks with `Regexp#match?` so unlocked/style CI
  stays clean with newer RuboCop performance cops.
- Cleared the remaining `rubocop_gradual` backlog and removed the lock file.

## [2.0.1] - 2026-05-25

- TAG: [v2.0.1][2.0.1t]
- COVERAGE: 94.88% -- 2911/3068 lines in 21 files
- BRANCH COVERAGE: 78.43% -- 1200/1530 branches in 21 files
- 76.25% documented

### Added

- Added `kettle-changelog --update-prep` to refresh the most recent prepared
  release section in place, including date, coverage, documentation stats, and
  any follow-up Unreleased notes.

### Changed

- `kettle-changelog` now generates strict coverage data with
  `bundle exec kettle-test`, preserving the faster `turbo_tests2` runner.
- `kettle-changelog` now treats configured coverage thresholds as a changelog
  preparation gate by default; use `--no-coverage-threshold` or
  `K_CHANGELOG_COVERAGE_HARD=false` to generate changelog metadata without
  threshold enforcement.
- The shared `rake spec` task now delegates to `bundle exec kettle-test`, so
  projects using kettle-dev automatically pick up kettle-test's default
  `turbo_tests2` runner and summary output.
- The shared `:yard` task now installs `yard-fence` and `yard-timekeeper` integrations explicitly so documentation prep and post-processing only run during `rake yard`

- Refreshed generated kettle-jem templates, CI workflows, curated binstubs, and
  local modular Gemfile wiring.
- `kettle-changelog` now auto-selects the correct no-argument action by
  comparing `version.rb`, the latest live release, and the most recent
  CHANGELOG.md release section before prompting for confirmation.
- Updated the development dependency on `kettle-test` to require 2.0.1 or newer.

### Fixed

- Loading YARD during unrelated rake tasks no longer triggers documentation plugin side effects that rewrite or clear `docs/`

- `rake reek:update` now resolves the Reek gem executable directly instead of
  shelling through `bundle exec reek`, avoiding stale project binstubs, and no
  longer fails the default task solely because Reek reported smells while
  refreshing the `REEK` backlog file.
- `rake reek:update` now keeps `REEK` zero-byte when Reek reports no smells
  instead of writing a single blank line.

## [2.0.0] - 2026-02-25

- TAG: [v2.0.0][2.0.0t]
- COVERAGE: 96.06% -- 2683/2793 lines in 20 files
- BRANCH COVERAGE: 79.16% -- 1113/1406 branches in 20 files
- 80.25% documented

### Added

- New `kettle-gh-release` executable for standalone GitHub release creation
  - Extracted from `kettle-release` step 18
  - Useful when RubyGems release succeeded but GitHub release failed
  - Supports explicit version via `version=<VERSION>` argument
  - Auto-detects version from `lib/**/version.rb` if not specified
  - Requires `GITHUB_TOKEN` with `repo:public_repo` (classic) or `contents:write` scope
- Added `.kettle-dev.yml` configuration file for per-file merge options
  - Hybrid format: `defaults` for shared merge options, `patterns` for glob fallbacks, `files` for per-file config
  - Nested directory structure under `files` allows individual file configuration
  - Supports all `Prism::Merge::SmartMerger` options: `preference`, `add_template_only_nodes`, `freeze_token`, `max_recursion_depth`
  - Added `TemplateHelpers.kettle_config`, `.config_for`, `.find_file_config` methods
  - Added spec coverage in `template_helpers_config_spec.rb`

### Changed

- Updated documentation on hostile takeover of RubyGems
  - https://dev.to/galtzo/hostile-takeover-of-rubygems-my-thoughts-5hlo
- **BREAKING**: Replaced `template_manifest.yml` with `.kettle-dev.yml`
  - New hybrid format supports both glob patterns and per-file configuration
  - `TemplateHelpers.load_manifest` now reads from `.kettle-dev.yml` patterns section
  - `TemplateHelpers.strategy_for` checks explicit file configs before falling back to patterns
- **BREAKING**: Simplified `SourceMerger` to fully rely on prism-merge for AST merging
  - Reduced from ~610 lines to ~175 lines (71% reduction)
  - Removed custom newline normalization - prism-merge preserves original formatting
  - Removed custom comment deduplication logic - prism-merge handles this natively
  - All strategies (`:skip`, `:replace`, `:append`, `:merge`) now use prism-merge consistently
  - Freeze blocks (`kettle-dev:freeze` / `kettle-dev:unfreeze`) handled by prism-merge's `freeze_token` option

### Removed

- Removed all `.example` template files from the kettle-dev root and subdirectories
  (27 files). Template files now live exclusively in kettle-jem's `template/` directory.
  Only `.env.local.example` is retained as a dev resource for all destination gems.
- Removed unused methods from `SourceMerger`:
  - `normalize_source` - replaced by prism-merge
  - `normalize_newlines` - prism-merge preserves original formatting
  - `shebang?`, `magic_comment?`, `ruby_magic_comment_key?` - no longer needed
  - Comment extraction/deduplication: `extract_magic_comments`, `extract_file_leading_comments`,
    `create_comment_tuples`, `deduplicate_comment_sequences`, `deduplicate_sequences_pass1`,
    `deduplicate_singles_pass2`, `extract_nodes_with_comments`, `count_blank_lines_before`,
    `build_source_from_nodes`
  - Unused comment restoration: `restore_custom_leading_comments`, `deduplicate_leading_comment_block`,
    `extract_comment_lines`, `normalize_comment`, `leading_comment_block`
- Removed unused constants: `RUBY_MAGIC_COMMENT_KEYS`, `MAGIC_COMMENT_REGEXES`

### Fixed

- Fixed `PrismAppraisals` various comment chunk spacing
  - extract_block_header:
    - skips the blank spacer immediately above an `appraise` block
    - treats any following blank line as the stop boundary once comment lines have been collected
    - prevents preamble comments from being pulled into the first block’s header
  - restores expected ordering:
    - magic comments and their blank line stay at the top
    - block headers remain adjacent to their blocks
    - preserves blank lines between comment chunks
- Fixed `SourceMerger` freeze block location preservation
  - Freeze blocks now stay in their original location in the file structure
  - Skip normalization for files with existing freeze blocks to prevent movement
  - Only include contiguous comments immediately before freeze markers (no arbitrary 3-line lookback)
  - Don't add freeze reminder to files that already have freeze/unfreeze blocks
  - Prevents unrelated comments from being incorrectly captured in freeze block ranges
  - Added comprehensive test coverage for multiple freeze blocks at different nesting levels
- Fixed `TemplateTask` to not override template summary/description with empty strings from destination gemspec
  - Only carries over summary/description when they contain actual content (non-empty)
  - Allows token replacements to work correctly (e.g., `kettle-dev summary` → `my-gem summary`)
  - Prevents empty destination fields from erasing meaningful template values
- Fixed `SourceMerger` magic comment ordering and freeze block protection
  - Magic comments now preserve original order
  - No blank lines inserted between consecutive magic comments
  - Freeze reminder block properly separated from magic comments (not merged)
  - Leverages Prism's built-in `parse_result.magic_comments` API for accurate detection
  - Detects `kettle-dev:freeze/unfreeze` pairs using Prism, then reclassifies as file-level comments to keep blocks intact
  - Removed obsolete `is_magic_comment?` method in favor of Prism's native detection
- Fixed `PrismGemspec` and `PrismGemfile` to use pure Prism AST traversal instead of regex fallbacks
  - Removed regex-based `extract_gemspec_emoji` that parsed `spec.summary =` and `spec.description =` with regex
  - Now traverses Prism AST to find Gem::Specification block, extracts summary/description nodes, and gets literal values
  - Removed regex-based source line detection in `PrismGemfile.merge_gem_calls`
  - Now uses `PrismUtils.statement_key` to find source statements via AST instead of `ln =~ /^\s*source\s+/`
  - Aligns with project goal: move away from regex parsing toward proper AST manipulation with Prism
  - All functionality preserved, tested, and working correctly
- Fixed `PrismGemspec.replace_gemspec_fields` block parameter extraction to use Prism AST
  - **CRITICAL**: Was using regex fallback that incorrectly captured entire block body as parameter name
  - Removed buggy regex fallback in favor of pure Prism AST traversal
  - Now properly extracts block parameter from Prism::BlockParametersNode → Prism::ParametersNode → Prism::RequiredParameterNode
- Fixed `PrismGemspec.replace_gemspec_fields` insert offset calculation for emoji-containing gemspecs
  - **CRITICAL**: Was using character length (`String#length`) instead of byte length (`String#bytesize`) to calculate insert offset
  - When gemspecs contain multi-byte UTF-8 characters (emojis like 🍲), character length != byte length
  - This caused fields to be inserted at wrong byte positions, resulting in truncated strings and massive corruption
  - Changed `body_src.rstrip.length` to `body_src.rstrip.bytesize` for correct byte-offset calculations
  - Prevents gemspec templating from producing corrupted output with truncated dependency lines
  - Added comprehensive debug logging to trace byte offset calculations and edit operations
- Fixed `SourceMerger` variable assignment duplication during merge operations
  - `node_signature` now identifies variable/constant assignments by name only, not full source
  - Previously used full source text as signature, causing duplicates when assignment bodies differed
  - Added specific handlers for: LocalVariableWriteNode, InstanceVariableWriteNode, ClassVariableWriteNode, ConstantWriteNode, GlobalVariableWriteNode
  - Also added handlers for ClassNode and ModuleNode to match by name
  - Example: `gem_version = ...` assignments with different bodies now correctly merge instead of duplicating
  - Prevents `bin/kettle-dev-setup` from creating duplicate variable assignments in gemspecs and other files
  - Added comprehensive specs for variable assignment deduplication and idempotency
- Fixed `SourceMerger` conditional block duplication during merge operations
  - `node_signature` now identifies conditional nodes (if/unless/case) by their predicate only
  - Previously used full source text, causing duplicate blocks when template updates conditional bodies
  - Example: if ENV["FOO"] blocks with different bodies now correctly merge instead of duplicating
  - Prevents `bin/kettle-dev-setup` from creating duplicate if/else blocks in gemfiles
  - Added comprehensive specs for conditional merging behavior and idempotency
- Fixed `PrismGemspec.replace_gemspec_fields` to use byte-aware string operations
  - **CRITICAL**: Was using character-based `String#[]=` with Prism's byte offsets
  - This caused catastrophic corruption when emojis or multi-byte UTF-8 characters were present
  - Symptoms: gemspec blocks duplicated/fragmented, statements escaped outside blocks
  - Now uses `byteslice` and byte-aware concatenation for all edit operations
  - Prevents gemspec templating from producing mangled output with duplicated Gem::Specification blocks
- Fixed `PrismGemspec.replace_gemspec_fields` to correctly handle multi-byte UTF-8 characters (e.g., emojis)
  - Prism uses byte offsets, not character offsets, when parsing Ruby code
  - Changed string slicing from `String#[]` to `String#byteslice` for all offset-based operations
  - Added validation to use `String#bytesize` instead of `String#length` for offset bounds checking
  - Prevents `TypeError: no implicit conversion of nil into String` when gemspecs contain emojis
  - Ensures gemspec field carryover works correctly with emoji in summary/description fields
  - Enhanced error reporting to show backtraces when debug mode is enabled

- Comprehensive newline normalization in templated Ruby files:
  - Magic comments (frozen_string_literal, encoding, etc.) always followed by single blank line
  - No more than one consecutive blank line anywhere in file
  - Single newline at end of file (no trailing blank lines)
  - Freeze reminder block now includes blank line before and empty comment line after for better visual separation

- 95.35% documented

### Added

- kettle-release: Add a sanity check for the latest released version of the gem being released, and display it during the confirmation with user that CHANGELOG.md and version.rb have been updated, so they can compare the value in version.rb with the value of the latest released version.
  - If the value in version.rb is less than the latest released version's major or minor, then check for the latest released version that matches the major + minor of what is in version.rb.
  - This way a stable branch intended to release patch updates to older versions is able to work use the script.
- kettle-release: optional pre-push local CI run using `act`, controlled by env var `K_RELEASE_LOCAL_CI` ("true" to run, "ask" to prompt) and `K_RELEASE_LOCAL_CI_WORKFLOW` to choose a workflow; defaults to `locked_deps.yml` when present; on failure, soft-resets the release prep commit and aborts.
- template task: now copies `certs/pboling.pem` into the host project when available.

- BRANCH COVERAGE: 96.00% -- 48/50 branches in 7 files
- 95.35% documented

### Fixed

- kettle-release: ensure SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH is applied within the same shell for both build and release by prefixing the commands with the env var (e.g., `SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH=$epoch bundle exec rake build` and `... rake release`); prevents losing the variable across shell boundaries and improves reproducible checksums.

## [1.0.5] - 2025-08-24

- TAG: [v1.0.5][1.0.5t]
- COVERAGE: 100.00% -- 130/130 lines in 7 files
- BRANCH COVERAGE: 96.00% -- 48/50 branches in 7 files
- 95.35% documented

### Fixed

- kettle-release: will run regardless of how it is invoked (i.e. works as binstub)

## [1.0.4] - 2025-08-24

- TAG: [v1.0.4][1.0.4t]
- COVERAGE: 100.00% -- 130/130 lines in 7 files
- BRANCH COVERAGE: 96.00% -- 48/50 branches in 7 files
- 95.35% documented

### Added

- kettle-release: checks all remotes for a GitHub remote and syncs origin/trunk with it; prompts to rebase or --no-ff merge when histories diverge; pushes to both origin and the GitHub remote on merge; uses the GitHub remote for GitHub Actions CI checks, and also checks GitLab CI when a GitLab remote and .gitlab-ci.yml are present.
- kettle-release: push logic improved — if a remote named `all` exists, push the current branch to it (assumed to cover multiple push URLs). Otherwise push the current branch to `origin` and to any GitHub, GitLab, and Codeberg remotes (whatever their names are).

### Fixed

- kettle-release now validates SHA256 checksums of the built gem against the recorded checksums and aborts on mismatch; helps ensure reproducible artifacts (honoring SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH).
- kettle-release now enforces CI checks and aborts if CI cannot be verified; supports GitHub Actions and GitLab pipelines, including releases from trunk/main.
- kettle-release no longer requires bundler/setup, preventing silent exits when invoked from a dependent project; adds robust output flushing.

## [1.0.3] - 2025-08-24

### Added

- template task now copies .git-hooks files necessary for git hooks to work

### Fixed

- kettle-release now uses the host project's root, instead of this gem's installed root.
- Added .git-hooks files necessary for git hooks to work

## [1.0.2] - 2025-08-24

- TAG: [v1.0.2][1.0.2t]

- COVERAGE: 100.00% -- 98/98 lines in 7 files
- BRANCH COVERAGE: 100.00% -- 30/30 branches in 7 files
- 94.59% documented

### Added

- These were documented but not yet released:
  - `kettle-release` ruby script for safely, securely, releasing a gem.
    - This may move to its own gem in the future.
  - `kettle-readme-backers` ruby script for integrating Open Source Collective backers into a README.md file.
    - This may move to its own gem in the future.

## [1.0.0] - 2025-08-24

- TAG: [v1.0.0][1.0.0t]
- COVERAGE: 100.00% -- 98/98 lines in 7 files
- BRANCH COVERAGE: 100.00% -- 30/30 branches in 7 files
- 94.59% documented

### Added

- initial release, with auto-config support for:
  - bundler-audit
  - rake
  - require_bench
  - appraisal2
  - gitmoji-regex (& git-hooks to enforce gitmoji commit-style)
  - via kettle-test
    - Note: rake tasks for kettle-test are added in _this gem_ (kettle-dev) because test rake tasks are a development concern
    - rspec
      - although rspec is the focus, most tools work with minitest as well
    - rspec-block_is_expected
    - rspec-stubbed_env
    - silent_stream
    - timecop-rspec
- `kettle:dev:install` rake task for installing githooks, and various instructions for optimal configuration
- `kettle:dev:template` rake task for copying most of this gem's files (excepting bin/, docs/, exe/, sig/, lib/, specs/) to another gem, as a template.
- `ci:act` rake task CLI menu / scoreboard for a project's GHA workflows
  - Selecting will run the selected workflow via `act`
  - This may move to its own gem in the future.
